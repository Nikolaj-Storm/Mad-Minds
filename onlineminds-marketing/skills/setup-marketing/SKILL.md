name: setup-marketing
description: First-session onboarding for a new marketer in the Mad Minds project. Walks them through authorizing every required connector (Google Drive, Google Search Console, Google Ads), verifies Drive access to Mad Minds, asks their first name and confirms their personal folder, and ends with a capabilities overview of every skill they can run. Triggered automatically by CLAUDE.md on first session, or manually as /setup-marketing whenever a marketer wants to re-verify their setup. Use whenever a marketer is new, says "hi" / "what can you do" / "I just installed this", or asks to check their connectors.
argument-hint: "(no args — runs interactively)"

# Setup — Mad Minds Marketing Project

> Load `account-conventions` first. This skill is interactive; treat the user as a marketer (non-engineer). One question or check per turn. Keep momentum — don't dump the whole flow at once.

## Goal
By the end of this skill, the marketer:
1. Has every required connector authorized (or knows exactly which one is blocking them).
2. Can see their personal folder in Mad Minds.
3. Knows what `onlineminds-marketing` lets them do.
4. Has run one tiny live command successfully.

## Flow

### Step 1 — Greet and orient (one short paragraph)
Welcome them to the Mad Minds project. Explain in two sentences: this is the marketing department's shared workspace; Claude can analyze ad/SEO/analytics data, act on it (pause/budget/bid changes with safety gates), and write reports straight into the shared Drive. Tell them this onboarding takes ~5 minutes and they can re-run it anytime by typing `/setup-marketing`.

### Step 2 — Identify the marketer (pick existing or add new)

The marketer's personal workspace lives at `Mad Minds/07_People/<lowercase-first-name>/`. Don't guess and don't ask them to type a freeform name — present a list so the right folder is always picked.

**Sequence:**

1. **List existing people folders.** Use the Google Drive connector to search for child folders under `07_People/` (parent ID `1PK1wSKcL81X8cV8LiY0D8oFGGwQi8kR2`, mimeType `application/vnd.google-apps.folder`). Sort alphabetically. (If the Drive connector isn't connected yet, jump to Step 3 first and come back here once it is.)

2. **Present the dropdown via AskUserQuestion.** Use AskUserQuestion with one question — "Which of these is you?" — and offer:
   - Each existing folder name (lowercase first name) as a labelled option
   - The user always gets an automatic "Other" option (the AskUserQuestion tool adds this) — when they pick "Other" they can type their first name

3. **If they pick an existing name:** confirm `07_People/<name>/` is theirs and move on to Step 3.

4. **If they pick "Other" and type a new first name:**
   - Lowercase it and strip whitespace.
   - Confirm with them: "I'll create `07_People/<name>/` for you with the standard subfolders (reports, plans, data, notes, archive) and a README. Continue?"
   - On yes, create the full structure via the Drive connector:
     - One folder `<name>` under `07_People/` (parent ID `1PK1wSKcL81X8cV8LiY0D8oFGGwQi8kR2`)
     - Five subfolders inside it: `reports`, `plans`, `data`, `notes`, `archive`
     - One Google Doc named `README` inside `<name>/` — content mirrors what's in the other people folders' READMEs (explains the subfolder purposes, naming conventions, version-history note, cleanup norm). You can copy the structure from any existing person's README to keep them consistent.
   - Tell the user the folder is built and give them the direct Drive link to their new folder.
   - Also update `01_Knowledge_Base/account-conventions-live` section 6 (Team Roster) by appending the new name to the list (preserve the existing names; just add a comma-separated entry).

### Step 3 — Connect the tools (Customize → Connectors)

All connecting happens in **Customize → Connectors** (the top-level panel). Google Drive is in Claude's built-in catalog; **Google Search Console and Google Ads are added as *custom connectors*** (paste a URL). The custom-connector path uses Claude's hosted sign-in, which is the reliable one.

> IMPORTANT: Do NOT authenticate Google Search Console or Google Ads through an in-session sign-in link (a `localhost` URL). Claude desktop's plugin/in-session OAuth listener is unreliable — it fails with "no flow in progress" and the tools never register. Always use the **Add custom connector** path below. (There is no `authenticate` tool to call for these now — they aren't plugin servers anymore.)

For each connector: say what it's for in one sentence, test it with a trivial read, and if it isn't connected give the exact steps and wait for "done" before re-testing. If one won't connect after two tries, note it and move on — don't block onboarding.

- **Google Drive** (built-in catalog) — the Mad Minds Hub. Steps: Customize → Connectors → **Google Drive → Connect** → sign in with `@onlineminds.io`.
- **Google Search Console** (custom connector) — organic clicks/impressions/positions; read-only; they see only their own verified properties. Steps: Customize → Connectors → **Add custom connector** → URL `https://onlineminds-gsc-mcp.fly.dev/mcp` → leave Advanced settings empty → **Add** → **Connect** → sign in with the Google account that has their Search Console. (After connecting, a new session may be needed for the tools to appear.)
- **Google Ads** (custom connector) — campaign reporting + management (read+write); per-user; they see only accounts they can access; writes simulate (READONLY_MODE) until enabled and route through `/ad-actions`. Steps: Customize → Connectors → **Add custom connector** → URL `https://onlineminds-gads-mcp.fly.dev/mcp` → leave Advanced settings empty → **Add** → **Connect** → sign in with the Google account that has their Google Ads.

Skip Notion / Slack / Supabase / Vercel unless the marketer asks — those are optional plugin connectors.

Not available yet (don't walk through; if asked, say they're coming): **Meta Ads** (Meta's official MCP, per-Business URL — not wired yet), **GA4**, **Google Tag Manager**, **Google Merchant Center**. For organic search, use Google Search Console.

If a connector fails to authorize twice in a row, note it in the summary and continue. Do not block the whole onboarding on one connector.

### Step 4 — Show their personal folder
Tell them: "Your personal folder is `Mad Minds/07_People/<name>/`. Drafts and works-in-progress save here by default. When something's finished and useful to the team, say 'publish to the team' and the skill copies it into the right shared folder." Give them the direct link to their folder if you can construct it from the folder ID.

### Step 5 — Capabilities overview
Show them this — verbatim layout, headings exactly as shown:

> **Two plugins are installed and work together:**
> - **`onlineminds-marketing`** — OnlineMinds-specific skills, Mad Minds Drive routing, and the **only place** that touches live ad accounts (write-action skill with the spend-gate).
> - **`claude-ads`** — open-source paid-advertising audit toolkit (250+ checks across 8 platforms, Health Score, industry templates, PDF reports). Analysis-only.
>
> **From `onlineminds-marketing`:**
>
> Analyze (saves to your Drive folder)
> - `/monthly-paid-review <brand>` — Google + Meta paid report for the past month
> - `/wasted-spend-audit <brand>` — flag wasted ad spend, build an exclusion list
> - `/seo-geo-audit <brand> <market>` — SEO + AI-citability audit
> - `/competitor-scan <brand> <market>` — head-to-head competitive snapshot
>
> Plan
> - `/content-brief <brand> <type> <topic>` — brand-voice content brief
> - `/campaign-plan <brand> <goal>` — full campaign brief with channels, content, KPIs
>
> Act (live ad accounts, with safety gates)
> - `/ad-actions <brand> <change>` — pause/enable, budget/bid changes, add negatives, create ads/campaigns on Google + Meta, edit GTM. **Spend increases require you to type back a verbatim confirmation phrase** (Tier 1). Pauses and budget decreases are quick yes (Tier 2). GTM changes affecting conversion tracking are Tier 1.
>
> Document
> - `/report-builder` — assemble any of the above into a stakeholder-ready report
>
> **From `claude-ads`:**
>
> Audit (deep, scored, PDF-able)
> - `/ads audit` — full multi-platform audit with parallel agents, Health Score 0-100
> - `/ads google` · `/ads meta` · `/ads youtube` · `/ads linkedin` · `/ads tiktok` · `/ads microsoft` · `/ads apple` · `/ads amazon` — single-platform deep dives
> - `/ads creative` · `/ads landing` · `/ads budget` · `/ads attribution` · `/ads tracking` — cross-cutting audits
> - `/ads report` — generate PDF audit report
>
> Plan + math
> - `/ads plan <type>` — strategic plan by industry (saas, ecommerce, local-service, etc.)
> - `/ads math` — PPC financial calculator (CPA, ROAS, break-even, LTV:CAC)
> - `/ads test` — A/B test design (hypothesis, sample size, duration)
>
> Creative generation
> - `/ads dna <url>` · `/ads create` · `/ads generate` · `/ads photoshoot`
>
> **Common pattern:** `/ads audit` to find issues → `/ad-actions` to apply the fixes. The spend-gate enforces safety on writes regardless of which plugin surfaced the finding.
>
> **House rules I always follow**
> - I read `account-conventions` before every task — that's the shared brain (brands, KPIs, naming, routing rule, spend-gate rules).
> - Drafts save to your personal folder `07_People/<name>/`. Say "publish to the team" to move a finished version into the shared folder.
> - For Tier 1 ad changes, I'll show you a sentence like `I wish to increase the ad spending on rentumo.ie by $500`. Nothing happens until you type it back word-for-word. Say "read-only" anytime to make this session analysis-only.
> - `claude-ads` is analysis-only; it never writes to ad accounts directly. If you want to act on an `/ads` finding, I run it through `/ad-actions` so the spend-gate applies.

### Step 6 — Smoke test
Offer to run one of:
- `/account-conventions` (read-only, fastest — just loads the shared brain so they can see it works)
- "Show me last 7 days performance for `<brand>` on Google Ads" (tests Google Ads read)

Let them pick. Run it, narrate as you go ("pulling the data… writing a draft to your folder… done").

### Step 7 — Wrap-up summary
Recap in 4 lines:
- Which connectors are connected ✓
- Which (if any) failed and need them to retry (with the exact click path)
- Their personal folder path with link
- A pointer to `Mad Minds/00_START_HERE/` for the living docs

Then ask if they want to run a real task right now, or stop here.

## Style and constraints
- One question or one connector per turn. Never dump the whole connector list in one message.
- Never show raw connector JSON or error stacks. Translate failures into one sentence: "Google Ads isn't connected yet — add it via Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector with the URL https://onlineminds-gads-mcp.fly.dev/mcp, connect, then say done."
- Don't proceed past Step 3 until at least Google Drive is connected (otherwise the rest of the system is useless).
- If the user explicitly says "skip the setup, I know what I'm doing", confirm what they want to skip and jump straight to whatever task they name. But never skip naming the user — `07_People/<name>/` resolution requires it.
- Save a short log of this onboarding to `Mad Minds/06_Automation_Outputs/logs/` so the maintainer can see who's onboarded and which connectors failed for who.
